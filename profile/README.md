TEDxDYPatilUniversity is an independently organized event licensed from TED and run by the TEDxDYPatilUniversity organizing team. This group began the current iteration of TEDxDYPatilUniversity at Navi Mumbai in 2018, with a single day of ideas and performances. It has become the leading platform for the propagation of comprehensive ideas, creativity, and innovation to the rest of the community. We aim to create and foster a sense of community amongst the people and organizations who have gathered (and continue to gather) around this event; to provide a cultural focus and impetus for conversation and debate.
